# Project Plan

## Describe the Project

**Project Title**: Weather Website

**Overview**: This project is a simple, interactive weather website that allows users to check current weather conditions and basic forecasts for different cities. Users will enter a location, and the site will retrieve weather data, displaying temperature, conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy), and additional details. It will also provide a map view of the selected location.

**Goals**:
- Create a functional, user-friendly weather lookup tool.
- Practice skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and working with web APIs.

**Features**:
- Location search with input validation
- Embedded map for visual location display
- Dynamic weather data loading with Ajax
- User-friendly components, such as a date picker for future forecasts
- Data persistence with local storage (recently searched locations)

## Implementation Tasks

1. **Setup Basic Page Structure**
   - Create HTML for both pages: the main search page and the results page.
   - Add basic styling with CSS for layout and appearance.

2. **JavaScript and Input Validation**
   - Add JavaScript to handle the search form, ensuring the user enters a valid location.
   - Implement functions to handle validation errors (e.g., alerts for incorrect input).

3. **Weather Data Fetching (Ajax and JSON)**
   - Connect to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve JSON data.
   - Write JavaScript to parse and display the data on the results page.

4. **DOM Manipulation for Dynamic Content**
   - Use JavaScript and the DOM API to create and display elements like temperature, weather icon, humidity, and wind speed dynamically.

5. **Embedded Map and Video**
   - Embed an iframe displaying a Google Map or OpenStreetMap focused on the searched location.

6. **jQuery UI Component**
   - Integrate a jQuery date picker component to allow users to select a date for a weather forecast.

7. **Local Storage Setup**
   - Use local storage to save the userâ€™s last searched location and retrieve it when they return to the site.

8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test each component to ensure it works as expected.
   - Validate functionality across different browsers and devices.
