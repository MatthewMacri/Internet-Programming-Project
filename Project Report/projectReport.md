## Features
1. **Weather Search and Display**:
   - Users can search for weather details by entering the name of a city, state, or country.
   - Displays current temperature, wind speed, and weather description.
   
2. **Interactive Map**:
   - Integrated with Google Maps API, the map updates dynamically to show the selected city's location.

3. **Recent Searches**:
   - Keeps track of the last five searches using `localStorage`.
   - Allows users to revisit previous searches by clicking on them.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Fully responsive layout, optimized for various devices.

## Technical Details
1. **Frontend**:
   - **HTML**: Structured with semantic elements, including a form for city search and sections for weather data display and recent searches.
   - **CSS**: Styled with a modern and clean design, incorporating gradients, hover effects, and responsive styling.

2. **Backend**:
   - **JavaScript**:
     - Fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap's Geo and Weather APIs.
     - Integrates Google Maps API for map display and marker updates.
     - Implements local storage for recent searches and DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates.

3. **APIs Used**:
   - OpenWeatherMap API: For geocoding and weather data.
   - Google Maps API: For live map updates.

4. **Storage**:
   - Local Storage: Stores recent search history.

## How It Works
1. Users enter a city name in the input field and press "Search".
2. The app fetches the latitude and longitude of the city using OpenWeatherMap's Geo API.
3. Weather data is retrieved and displayed using OpenWeatherMap's Weather API.
4. The map centers on the selected city, and a marker is placed at the location.
5. The app saves the search history in the browser's local storage, allowing quick access to past searches.

## Challenges and Future Improvements
1. **Challenges**:
   - Handling API errors and ensuring robust user input validation.
   - Optimizing map loading and rendering on slower devices.

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Add detailed weather parameters such as precipitation and UV index.
   - Support for multiple languages (i18n).
   - Extend functionality with weekly forecasts.

## File Descriptions
1. **index.html**: Defines the structure of the app, including the search form, weather display, and map section.
2. **script.js**: Contains the core logic for fetching weather data, updating the UI, managing recent searches, and integrating with Google Maps.
3. **styles.css**: Styles the app with a modern design, ensuring responsiveness and user-friendliness.
